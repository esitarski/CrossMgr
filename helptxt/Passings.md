# History
Results shows rider information similar to how it would be captured in a CycloCross scoring sheet.
The race leader is listed at the top of each lap column, followed by the other riders.

Unlike a manual scoring sheet, CrossMgr automatically determines who the leader is.

# Screen
The top of the screen contains controls.

The bottom contains a table showing the riders and their arrival times by lap.

The title of each lap contains the following information:

Field|Description
:----|:----------
Lap|The rider's lap
Laps to Go|The number of laps to go in the race for the Leader's category
Lap Time|The time of the Lap
Race Time|The time of the Race when the lap occured

Projected and auto-corrected entries suggested by CrossMgr are highlighed in yellow.  Manually edited times are shown in orange.  Highlights indicate that some adjustment has been made to the times that was not present in the originally collected data.  For more details about why/who/when, double-click on the entry and look at the entry details in RiderDetail.

# Controls
## Category
Selects the Category of the results.  Category __All__ will show results as if all riders were in one category.  This is useful for comparing against manually collected data for the race as a whole.

## Race Times
Shows the race time for each entry.

## Lap Times
Shows the lap time for each entry.

## Time Down per Lap
Shows the time down per lap.  This is useful to determine if riders are close to getting lapped.

## Rider Names

## Search
Searches for the entered number and highlights it in the Results page.  This is a very useful feature when some asks "what happened to rider XXX?"

## Zoom In/Zoom Out
If you find the text to hard to read (perhaps you are in direct sunlight), or you want to see more information on the screen, you can change the text size by pressing the Zoom In or Zoom Out buttons.

# Additional Features

## Single-click
