# Animation
Animation shows an animation of riders in the race.  While a race is running, it shows the projected rider's progress in real time.
After a race has finished, the race can be played back in fast-forward.

The default display is a oval track, however, you can also import a GPX file of the actual race course.

The top three riders are shown on a leader board (5 in GPX display), and you can enter additional riders you wish to highlight and show on the leader board.

It is considered best practice to play back every race before publishing the results as Animation is an excellent tool for spotting bad data.

# Screen
The top of the screen contains controls, followed by an idealized race course, including the start/finish line.

# Controls
## Category
Selects the Category of the animation.  Category "All" will show an animation for all riders in the entire race.

## Finish on Top
Draws the animation with the finish line on the top of the screen rather than on the bottom.
Use this option to give a better approximation of the course layout.
Html output will respect this option.
This option can also be changed in [Properties][].
Does not apply in a GPX display.

## Reverse Direction
Changes the direction of the animation.
Use this option to give a better approximation of the direction of prevailing turns in the race.
Html output will respect this option.
This option can also be changed in [Properties][].
Does not apply in a GPX display.

## Rewind
Rewinds the animation to the beginning.  Not operable while the race is running.

## Play/Stop
Controls the animation.  Not operable while the race is running.

## Playback Speed
Controls the speed of the playback (slowest to fastest).  Not operable while the race is running.

## Highlight Numbers
Highlights a list of comma-separated numbers, both in the animation and on the leader board.
The leader board shows the current position of the highlighted riders during the race, in addition to the top three (gold, silver and bronze).

For example, say a rider says he finished in 3rd place, but was ranked 5th.  The rider does not believe that two riders passed him during the race.
By highlighting all the riders in question and running the animiation, you can show exactly when and how the rider was overtaken.
