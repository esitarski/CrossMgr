# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## I have Lapped Riders.  Why doesn't CrossMgr show all their laps?

CrossMgr assumes that all riders finish on the leader's last lap.  If a rider complete fewer laps than the leader, he/she is ranked by laps completed, then by finish time.

If you are not pulling riders who have been lapped, and you want them to finish the full race distance, select the __Lapped Riders Continue__ option in [Categories][].

This tells CrossMgr that all riders are doing the full distance and to count all their laps.
