# Result Notes
Manages Result Notes for each participant.  Result Notes are useful to add extra information.
Result Notes are output in the HTML results, and also uploaded to RaceDB to be shown on its results screens.

You can use Result Notes for Warnings and Penalties, Fines, or any other information you want to add per rider.

Result Notes can be edited for an individual rider on the [RiderDetail][] screen.

The __Result Notes__ screen is a more powerful method to add Result Notes, and enables you to add the same Result Note to multiple participants at the same time.

Add appends the new notes to existing notes - it does not replace them.

For example if you want add a note about littering to riders 10, 16 and 17, enter "10 16 17" as the bibs, then enter "$25 fine for littering" in the Notes section, and press OK.
This adds the note to the three riders.
