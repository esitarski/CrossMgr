# Histogram
Arrival times of riders shown as a Histogram.
Rider categories are shown in different colors.

The purpose of the __Histogram__ is two-fold:

First, it can be used for Category analysis.  Look at the Last lap for all Catogires in a Start Wave (see [Categories][] for details).  With each category in a differeent color, the __Histogram__ makes it easy to see if novice athletes placed ahead of advanced athletes, or advanced athletes placed behind novice athletes.

Novice athletes who consistently place ahead of advance are candidates for upgrades.  Advanced athletes who consistently place behind novice athletes could be candidates for downgrades.

Second, the __Histogram__ can be used to analyse rider arrival frequency.  By looking at the arrivals per minute on each lap, it is easy to see:

1. Was the course selective?  Did the riders ride around in a pack, or were they separated at the finish?
1. Were there were too many riders arriving to handle with manual entry, and is chip timing recommended?
1. Were the start waves effective?  Was there crowding on the first few laps?

# Screen
Adjust the controls on the top to select the __Category__, __Lap__ and __Bin by__ options.  The __Bin by__ option controls the width of the histogram bins.  CrossMgr will choose what it thinks is a reasonable width, however, if you are interested in the arrival frequency, you can override this to fixed values.

Mouse-over the histogram on the bottom to see individual rider and category details.  Different categories are shown in different colors.
