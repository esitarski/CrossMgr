See [RFID Options][] for details.

# Checklist

A task checklist.  The checklist helps you keep track of important steps in the timing process.  It does not change the functionality of CrossMgr in any way.

To change a task's status, right-click, or double-click on the task's name.

Only subtasks can be checked - parent tasks will automatically be checked off when all subtasks are complete.
