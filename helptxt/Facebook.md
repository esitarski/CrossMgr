# Publishing Results to [Facebook](www.facebook.com)

Facebook does not allow any other content than photos - no html files, and no pdf files.

The key problem with images is that search engines (Google, Bing, Yahoo, etc.) cannot index them.  This makes it much harder for anyone to find their results from a web search.

A graphic cannot be searched in the browser with Ctrl+f.  This makes it harder for riders to find their names in the results page.

At higher magnification, a graphic appears "pixelated" (blurry).  This does not look nice, especially when printed.

Publishing images should be considered a "method of last resort".

Consider these options:

1. Post the CrossMgr HTML output in [pastehtml](www.pastehtml.com), then link to that from Facebook
1. Post the CrossMgr HTML output to [dropbox](www.dropbox.com), then link to that from Facebook
1. Create a pdf file from CrossMgr and post it to [Scribd](www.scribd.com), then link to that from Facebook
1. Finally, generate graphics files (png) from CrossMgr, and drag-and-drop those files directly to Facebook

All methods are easy but each has its advantages and disadvantages.  By investing a small amount of time, you can get higher quality results that are easier for your riders to find.

## Post the CrossMgr HTML output to [pastehtml](www.pastehtml.com), then link to that page from Facebook

Recommended.

From CrossMgr, do a "Publish/Publish Results as HTML...".  This will generate an html file with the results and write it in the same folder as the race file with a ".html".  It will also open the results page in your browser.
On your computer, start Notepad, then open the results .html file.  Do a "Edit|Select All", then "Edit|Copy" (or Ctrl-a and Ctrl-c).

Login to [pastehtml](www.pasthtml.com) with your Facebook login.
On the pasthtml page, select the entire contents of the "Paste your HTML code or plain text" section.  Press Ctrl-v to replace this with the CrossMgr Results html contents.  Then click on "Publish Page".  Keep clicking through the preview even if you don't see anything.  Use the address returned from pasthtml as a link on your Facebook page.

**Advantages:** shows complete CrossMgr output, dynamic results categories and lap data, animation, fancy Google map buttons, searchable on the page with Ctrl-f, and indexed by Google and other search engines.

**Disadvantages:**  A bit of cutting-and-pasting to get the html file posted properly in pasthtml, and you have to include the link in Facebook.

## Post the CrossMgr HTML output to [dropbox](www.dropbox.com), then link to that page from Facebook

Recommended.

From CrossMgr, do a "Publish/Publish Results as HTML...".  This will generate an html file with the results and write it in the same folder as the race file with a ".html".  Now, login to dropbox.  If you don't have a login, you will need to create one.
Upload the CrossMgr html results file to the Public dropbox folder.  Right-click on the file and select "Copy Public Link".  Paste this link in Facebook.

**Advantages:** shows complete CrossMgr output, dynamic results categories and lap data, animation, fancy Google map buttons, searchable on the page with Ctrl-f, and indexed by Google and other search engines.  Not a big hassle if you already have a dropbox account.

**Disadvantages:**  You have to set up a dropbox account.  However, if you install the dropbox client, it will automatically synchronize files on your computer.  This means that if you change the results, they will automatcially synchronize without having to re-post them.  You also have to include the link in Facebook.

## Create a pdf file from CrossMgr and post it to [Scribd](www.scribd.com), then link to the pdf file from Facebook

Somewhat recommended.

Download and install [TinyPDF](www.tinypdf.com).  Print CrossMgr results, and select the TinyPDF printer.  This will prompt you for the name of your the pdf file you want to save.  After generating the pdf file, log into [Scribd](www.scribd.com) with your Facebook login.  Upload the pdf file you generated.  Post the Scribd link on your Facebook page.

**Advantages:** nice printed-page look, shows complete CrossMgr output, searchable on the page with Ctrl-f, and indexed by Google and other search engines.

**Disadvantages:**  Have to download TinyPDF.  No results animation, no dynamic results categories or lap info, no fancy Google map buttons.  A bit of trouble to save and post the pdf file to Scribd and include the link in Facebook.

## Generate graphics files (png) from CrossMgr, and drag-and-drop those files directly to Facebook

Not recommended.

From CrossMgr, do a "Publish/Publish Results for Facebook (as PNG)...".  This will write all the results to a 'ResultsPNG" folder in the same folder as the CrossMgr race file.

Log into Facebook.  Select "Add Photos/video".  On your computer, go to the "ResultsPNG" folder.  Drag-and-drop all the png files into your Facebook post.

**Advantages:** "quickest and dirtiest" way to post CrossMgr results to Facebook.  No additional logins or links to deal with.

**Disadvantages:**  because the results files are in a graphic format, they are neither dynamic nor searchable.  They cannot be searched with Ctrl-f, and none of the search engines (like Google) can index them.  The graphics files are also very large compared to html or pdf files.  The graphics look "pixelated" at higher magnification and blurry when printed.
