## Windows
Opens/Closes screens in a separate window.  This is especially useful if you are using multiple screens and wish to show additional CrossMgr information while entering data in the main screen.

Choose the screen you wish to open in a separate window.  Drag it/resize it as needed.

For example, you can show the Animation while doing data entry.  Or Results.  Or the Chart.  Or the Situation screen.  Any, or all of the above.  Your choice.

The separate screens have identical display and edit capabilities as the regular screens.
