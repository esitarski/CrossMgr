## Show 100s of a second
Toggles the display of times to 100s of a second.  Same as setting the option in [Properties](Properties.html).

## Play Sounds
Toggles whether CrossMgr makes sounds.  These include the "ta-da" 3 seconds before the race leader, and the bell on the last lap.

## Sync Categories between Tabs
Toggle whether the Category is synchronized between all screens.  If not set, Categories can be changed independently in different screens.  Sometimes this is useful if you are working with two categories at a time in different screens.

## Set Contact Email...

This is the email presented on the web page that viewers can use to send feedback and ask questions.
Clicking on the email link will set the Subject to the name of the race.

To return to the default CrossMgr graphic, set this to an empty field.
