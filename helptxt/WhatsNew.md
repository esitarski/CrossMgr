# What's New in CrossMgr

## May 4, 2024

Re-factored the Riders on Course table on the Record page.
This display was simplified to show the riders on course for all categories, and for each category
It also breaks down of the status of the riders (Starters, Finished, DNF, Pulled, etc.).

## Apr, 2024

Added Early Bell features.  All riders after the Early Bell will be on their last lap.

Early Bell can be set from the [Chart][] page, or from the [SetLaps][] dialog in the [Record][] page.

Setting Early Bell from the two screens makes sense.  On the Record page, you can set the time immediately.
On the Chart page, you can plan the best time to set an Early Bell based on the position of riders.

When Early Bell is set, riders will correctly show the Bell symbol in the Expected list.

## Mar, 2024

Added Bell and Finish Flag symbols to Expected and Recorded riders on the MainWin page.

## July 21, 2021
A new [SetLaps][] dialog was added.

__Set Laps__ allows you to easily change the number of laps while the race is running.
If provides all information about the current number of laps and the new proposed number including the winner's time and the time of the last rider on course (taking potential lapping into account, of course).

See [SetLaps][] for details.


## July 15, 2021

SprintMgr was updated.  In addition to many bug fixes and upgrades, a new Competition format was added.
