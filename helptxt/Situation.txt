# Situation
Shows the structure of riders in the race.

This screen clearly shows the structure of the race as it developed.


# Screen
Groups of riders are shown across a timeline at the top of the screen with gaps from the leader, and elapsed time between gaps.  Riders are considered in a group if they have less than one second between them.

Each group has a header.  The header shows the __Group Number__, the __Gap__ and the __Number of Riders__ in the group.

The group shown in green is the largest - the pack.

Lapped riders are shown by laps down, in brackets, to the right of their names in the group.

This screen is useful for understanding the race dynamics, how groups formed, when they formed
